This is where the data analysis takes place. Welcome. 

In the `feature_engineering` notebook, I broke apart the features into useable columns for analysis. 

In `Product_620` I analyzed and predicted sales for the product labeled 620. 

In `Product_1268_2` I analyzed and predicted sales for the product labeled 1268. 

I used both the ARIMA model and Linear Forecasting. I think the final product is the forecasting graph in the ARIMA model. It doesn't appear that the model fit the trend well. In the future, I would look to fine tune the parameters and possiblity choose a different model that enforces seasonality.
