# EECS731_5

The goal of this product was to use time series forecasting to predict product sales. 

I used data from https://www.kaggle.com/felixzhao/productdemandforecasting and analyzed sales for products 620 and 1268. 

I used the ARIMA model and Linear Forecasting to predict future sales. 

I found that neither model did an accurate job of forecasting the product sales. Both products seemed to be season so if I was going to try again, I would choose a model that incorperated seasonality.
